This is my day5 Task submission :

Tasks :

1) You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -

 So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.

Example 1: When the script is executed as

```./createDirectories.sh day 1 90```

then it creates 90 directories as ```day1 day2 day3 .... day90```

Ans=> To create a dynamic set of directories using Shell Script, you can use the following code in a file named createDirectories.sh:

#!/bin/bash

dir_name=$1
start_num=$2
end_num=$3

for ((i=$start_num; i<=$end_num; i++))
do
  mkdir -p $dir_name$i
done

Press ESC :wq => To save and exit createDirectories.sh file

Here, the script takes three arguments - dir_name which specifies the base name of the directories, start_num which is the starting number for the directories, and end_num which is the ending number for the directories.

When you run the script as ./createDirectories.sh day 1 90, it will create 90 directories with names day1, day2, day3, and so on, till day90. The mkdir -p command creates a directory even if the parent directory does not exist.

You can modify the script to suit your needs, for example, by changing the base name or the range of numbers for the directories.
