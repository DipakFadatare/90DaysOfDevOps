## Day04 Tasks Solution

1. Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
   
```
We all know about scripting languages like Python.. in a similar way, we have Shell Script - it is a file in which a user can list down tasks as commands that need to be done via automation.
In the world of Linux, we interact with kernel through a shell i.e., we pass commands into the shell, which then interprets it in order for the kernel to understand the request and provide end user
with a response or an output. Instead of executing commands one by one, we can list them down in a single file and execute the file instead. That file is referred to as a Shell Script.

Shell Script files have a ".sh" extension. Next time when you see a file similar to "test.sh" - remember it is a shell script!
```

2. What is #!/bin/bash? Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?

3. Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge.
