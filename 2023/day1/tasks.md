## Introduction - Day 1 [Basic Understanding of path that we started ]

This is the day you have to Take this challenge and start your #90DaysOfDevOps with the #TrainWithShubham Community

## Motivation
   The motivation behind the learning of DEVOPS is simple and clear . I observed DEVOPS role bit challenging, Everyday needs to be learned new things, Has scope to        interact with every team in the whole process of software development, Great carreer growth , Global remote and normal opportunities, High demand



 " **As per Malcolm Gladwell’s rule, it takes 10000 hours of practice to achieve mastery in any field. Having said that, it won’t be possible to become a DevOps expert overnight** "

## Application Release Process :

Every software(application) will gone through a several lifecycles before come into the public(live). The stages involved in it are :
<br/>
1. Idea<br/>
2. Requirements<br/>
3. Code<br/>
4. Test<br/>
5. Build & Package<br/>
6. Deploy<br/>
7. Operate & Monitor<br/>

The above process involves both Developers and Operations teams in an organisation to Complete Deployment.But, It is taking longer time. So, In order to solve this problem "**DEVOPS"** comes to resue.

so, now our real question is that what is **DEVOPS** ? How will it resque ? 

Now, First let's see what exactly **DEVOPS** ?<br/>
--> There is no particular definition for it, Because It's not a technology, It's not a tool, But, It is a methodology which uses multiple tools to address issues.
In simple terms, **DEVOPS** is a intersection of Development and operations or It is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools.
 
 **Challenges that DEVOPS Tries to solve ?**
 
 > Remove Roadblocks in the application delivery process by fully automating process and streamlining the processes.

> Eliminate Miscommunication and Lack of collaboration between DEV and OPS teams which leads to longer release process of an application.

> Eliminate Security concerns by implementing separate tools 

> Eliminate Manual testing process in the application testing by introducing Automation testing.

> Reduce Manual work which causes slow delivery, Error prone, Intransparent, Hard to trace the workflow and Not able to do proper knowledge sharing by Implementing collaboration and automation.


**As a DEVOPS ENGINEER what needs to know ?**

since, As i said above Devops born to make collaboration between DEV team and OPS teams. SO, Let's divide in these way only...

## On Development side

 >>How Developers Work ?<br>
 >>Which git flow they are using ?<br>
 >>Which SDLC process they are using ?<br>
 >>How applications are configured ?<br>
 >>How & what is automated testing ?

## On Operations side

>>Operating system & Linux basics<br>

  > Linux Basics<br>
  > Be comfortable Using CLI<br>
  > shell commands<br>
  > linux file system<br>
  > Server Management<br>
  > Network & Filesecurity<br>
  > Firewall, Proxy servers<br>
  > load balancers<br>
  > Http/HTTPS<br>
  > IP,DNS,Name Resolution

>>containers :

  > Virtualization<br>
  > Containers<br>
  >  Build Automation & CI-CD<br> 
  >  Artifact Repository<br>
  >  Build Tools and Package Manager<br>
  >  Configure complete CI&CD pipeline

>>Infrastructure as a servervice :

  > Learn any one cloud(AWs/GCP/AZURE)<br>
 
>>Container Orchestration :

  > Kubernetes<br>
  > Docker swarm

>>Monitoring

  > Track performance<br>
  >  Monitor Software<br>
  >   Monitor Infrastructure<br>
 
 >>Infrastructure as a code (IAC) :

   > Infrastructure provisioning tools like terraform<br>
   > Configuration Mnagement tools like anisble <br>
   > Know scripting languages ( shellscripting--for servers, python --for applications)

>> Version controlling system :

  > GIT

**Bonus Tip:**

	There is a fundamental difference between the “I am an expert” and “He is an expert”. Saying “I am an expert” does not cost you anything and hence has no actual value. 
o	Network with other experts and engage in conversations
