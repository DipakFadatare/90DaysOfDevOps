This is my day 7 submission of 90daysdevops challenge

Tasks :  

1) You have to install docker and jenkins in your system from your terminal using package managers : Done

 2) Write a small blog or article to install these tools using package managers on Ubuntu and CentOS : Done, check out my article link(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/installing-docker-jenkins-using-package-manager-ubuntu-supriya-surkar)

 3) check the status of docker service in your system (make sure you completed above tasks, else docker won't be installed) 

=> Use command : sudo service docker status 
  To check docker status

 4) stop the service jenkins and post before and after screenshots
=> Done 
use commands : 
1. sudo systemctl stop jenkins => to stop jenkins service
2. sudo systemctl start jenkins => to start jenkins service
3. sudo systemctl status jenkins => to check jenkins status
4. sudo systemctl enable jenkins => to enable jenkins

5) read about the commands systemctl vs service
 => systemctl and service are commands used to manage services in Linux, but they have some differences:

-systemctl is a command used in modern Linux distributions with the systemd init system. It provides advanced features and a comprehensive interface for managing services.

-service is a command used in older Linux distributions with the SysV init system. It offers a simpler interface for managing services.
Here are some common commands:

# systemctl:

start: Start a service.
stop: Stop a service.
restart: Restart a service.
enable: Enable a service to start automatically on system boot.
disable: Disable a service from starting automatically on system boot.
status: Check the status of a service.

# service:

<service> start: Start a service.
<service> stop: Stop a service.
<service> restart: Restart a service.
<service> status: Check the status of a service.

While systemctl offers more advanced features and better integration with systemd, service is still used for backward compatibility on some systems.
