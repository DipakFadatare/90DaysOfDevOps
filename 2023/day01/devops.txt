DevOps Roadmap

What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal that is: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.

And to make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage Automation.

What is Automation?

You have just saved us hours of manual work:- That is what my team lead told me when I wrote a script to find a whitelisted IP address for a user from a file. That is the power of automation which can save you time and long hours of manual work.

Why DevOps is Important?

DevOps is all about shrinking the long, drawn-out software release process from potentially years to being able to drop smaller releases more frequently
