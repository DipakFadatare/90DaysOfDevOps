 - What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure

 Automation: Automation involves using tools and processes to automate manual tasks. This can include tasks like deploying software, running tests, or configuring infrastructure. By automating these tasks, teams can save time and reduce errors, while also improving the consistency and reliability of their processes.

Scaling: Scaling involves increasing the capacity or performance of a system to handle increased demand. This can involve adding more servers, increasing the resources allocated to existing servers, or optimizing software performance. By scaling systems, teams can ensure that their applications and services can handle increased traffic and demand without becoming overwhelmed.

Infrastructure: Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware, software, and network components that support an application or service. This can include servers, storage devices, databases, load balancers, and other components. By managing infrastructure effectively, teams can ensure that their applications and services are reliable, secure, and scalable.
