  <summary>Linux History</summary>
  
- Linux is a free and open-source operating system that has a rich history. The development of Linux began in the early 1990s by a Finnish computer science student named **Linus Torvalds**.

In 1991, Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki and was working on a project to create a new operating system. At the time, the most popular operating systems were proprietary, such as Windows and Mac OS, and were not freely available for modification and distribution. Torvalds wanted to create an operating system that was free to use, modify, and distribute.

He started working on the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system, and released the first version of Linux on September 17, 1991. The kernel was based on the Unix operating system, but was completely rewritten to make it more efficient and easier to use.

The Linux kernel was released under the GNU General Public License, which meant that anyone could use, modify, and distribute the software for free. This quickly attracted a large community of developers who began contributing to the development of Linux.

Over the next few years, Linux gained popularity among developers and enthusiasts, but it was still considered a niche operating system. However, in the late 1990s, the rise of the internet and the need for powerful and reliable servers for hosting websites and services led to a rapid increase in the adoption of Linux.

Today, Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded devices. It is also the basis for many popular distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, that have made Linux more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

In summary, Linux was developed in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, who wanted to create a free and open-source operating system. Its development was based on the Unix operating system, and it's released under the GNU General Public License. Linux quickly gained popularity among developers and enthusiasts, but it was not until the late 1990s, with the rise of the internet that it became widely adopted. Today, Linux is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded devices and the basis for many popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian.

  <summary>Linux Operating System</summary>
  
- The open-source operating system, often known as Linux, is widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded devices. The architecture of Linux is based on a modular design which allows for customization to fit specific needs.

At the core of the operating system is the kernel. The kernel manages the system's resources such as memory, processors, and devices. It is a monolithic structure, integrating all system components into a single executable file.

To communicate with hardware, Linux uses device drivers - small programs that control specific hardware devices. These drivers are typically developed and maintained by the hardware device manufacturers.

  <summary>Architecture Of Linux Operating system</summary>
  
  - The architecture of Linux composed of kernel, shell and application program that is software.

  - HARDWARE: physical parts of a computer, such as central processing unit (CPU), monitor,
mouse, keyboard, hard disk and other connected devices to CPU.
  
  - KERNEL: A kernel is a computer program and is the central core part of an operating system.
It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware, most notably memory and
CPU time. It is an integral part of any operating system.

  - SHELL: Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
and shell scripts. It is a user interface for access to an operating system's services

  <summary>Basic Commands</summary>
  
  - The echo command print the information on the screen.
  
  ```
  
  echo
  
  ```
  
  ```
  
  ls 
  
  ```
  
  - This command list the files and the folders.
  
  ```
  
  cd  && pwd 
  
  ```
  
  - The cd command is change the direcotry and pwd is use print present working directory
  
  ```
  
  mkdir 
  
  ```
  
  - This command is used to mak new directory.
  
  ```
  
  mkdir -p <directory-name>
  
  ```
  
  - You can also make the hierarchy of the directory by using mkdir -p command.
  
  ```
  
  touch file-name 
  
  ```
  
  - By using touch command you can create the new file.
  
  ```
  
  cat > file-name
  
  ```
  
  - Using this command you can add content to the file.
