Create a simple file and do `ls -ltr` to see the details of the files [refer to Notes](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/tree/master/2023/day6/notes)
 
 Each of the three permissions are assigned to three defined categories of users. The categories are:
-	   owner   —   The owner of the file or  application.
-	"chown" is used to change the ownership permission of a file or directory.
-	   group   —   The group that owns the file or application.
-	"chgrp" is used to change the gropu permission of a file or directory.
-	   others  —   All users with access to the system. (outised the users are in a group)
-	"chmod" is used to change the other users permissions of a file or directory.

    As a task, change the user permissions of the file and note the changes after `ls -ltr`
Answer=> 
#!/bin/bash

# create a file and set permissions
touch test_file.txt
chmod 754 test_file.txt

# list the file details before changing permissions
echo "Before changing permissions:"
ls -ltr test_file.txt

# change the permissions to read, write, and execute for owner, read and execute for group, and read-only for others
chmod 644 test_file.txt

# list the file details after changing permissions
echo "After changing permissions:"
ls -ltr test_file.txt

This will create the file and set the initial permissions to 754, and then change the permissions to 644 later in the script.


OUTPUT : 
$ chmod 400 test_file.txt
